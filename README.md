#ü§ñ Symphonee Agent Communication Protocol#

Overview

This document defines the agent-to-agent communication contract for the Symphonee orchestration layer. It standardizes how agents exchange structured messages, enabling modular, scalable, and interoperable AI workflows.

Each agent adheres to a shared schema for message passing, with clear definitions for intents, payloads, and context. This allows agents to be composed dynamically and operate in parallel.

üîê Authentication

All agent communication uses OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens.

Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

üß© Generic Message Schema

Request

{
  "message_id": "uuid-1234",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-17T13:45:00Z",
  "sender_agent": "ContentIngestionAgent",
  "recipient_agent": "StructBotAgent",
  "intent": "tag_document",
  "payload": { ... },
  "context": { ... }
}

Response

{
  "message_id": "uuid-1234",
  "status": "success",
  "recipient_agent": "StructBotAgent",
  "response_payload": { ... },
  "logs": [ ... ]
}

üß† Agent Contracts

1. üè∑Ô∏è StructBotAgent

Capabilities:

tag_document

code_generation

code_analysis

search_digital_library

üîß tag_document Intent

Payload Example:

{
  "document_id": "doc-5678",
  "document_text": "Full extracted content here...",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "user_upload",
    "file_type": "pdf",
    "language": "en"
  }
}

Response Payload Example:

{
  "tags": ["AI", "multi-agent systems", "document ingestion"],
  "confidence_scores": {
    "AI": 0.98,
    "multi-agent systems": 0.91,
    "document ingestion": 0.87
  },
  "next_action_suggestion": {
    "agent": "DigitalLibraryAgent",
    "intent": "store_tagged_document",
    "priority": "high"
  }
}

Implementation Note: StructBotAgent wraps calls to its internal FastAPI endpoint:

POST /api/tag_document

The agent receives a Symphonee message, translates it into a REST API call, and returns the result in the standardized response format.

2. üìö DigitalLibraryAgent (aka LibraryUpdateAgent)

Capabilities:

store_tagged_document

retrieve_document

update_document_metadata

üîß store_tagged_document Intent

Payload Example:

{
  "document_id": "doc-5678",
  "tags": ["AI", "multi-agent systems"],
  "metadata": {
    "source": "user_upload",
    "file_type": "pdf",
    "language": "en",
    "ingested_by": "ContentIngestionAgent"
  },
  "raw_text": "Full extracted content here..."
}

Response Payload Example:

{
  "status": "stored",
  "mongo_id": "64c8f9e2a1b3",
  "index_status": "indexed",
  "available_for_agents": ["SummarizerAgent", "TutorAgent"]
}

Implementation Note: This agent interfaces with MongoDB and optionally a vector store. It receives tagged documents and persists them for future retrieval and semantic search.

3. üìÑ ContentIngestionAgent

Capabilities:

extract_gdoc_content

üîß extract_gdoc_content Intent

Payload Example:

{
  "gdoc_id": "1A2B3C4D5E",
  "auth_token": "oauth-token",
  "user_id": "user-abc"
}

Response Payload Example:

{
  "document_id": "doc-5678",
  "document_text": "Extracted content from Google Doc...",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "AI Collaboration Proposal",
    "author": "Jaclyn",
    "source": "Google Docs",
    "language": "en"
  },
  "next_action_suggestion": {
    "agent": "StructBotAgent",
    "intent": "tag_document"
  }
}

Implementation Note: This agent uses OAuth 2.0 Desktop App flow to access Google Docs, extract content, and prepare it for tagging and ingestion.

üß™ Error Handling

{
  "status": "error",
  "error_code": "EXTRACTION_FAILED",
  "message": "Google Docs API returned 403 Forbidden."
}

üîç Agent Registry (Optional Extension)

GET /api/agents

Response:

[
  {
    "agent_name": "StructBotAgent",
    "capabilities": ["tag_document", "code_analysis"]
  },
  {
    "agent_name": "DigitalLibraryAgent",
    "capabilities": ["store_tagged_document", "retrieve_document"]
  }
]

üß≠ Best Practices

Use UUIDs for message_id to ensure traceability.

Include next_action_suggestion to enable dynamic chaining.

Maintain context for session continuity and personalization.

Log all agent interactions for audit and debugging.

Agents should be stateless and composable.
