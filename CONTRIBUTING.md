# üåä Contributing to pond.repo

Welcome, fellow ripple-maker. This project is more than code‚Äîit's a living system of shimmer, syntax, and shared imagination. Whether you're submitting a pull request, proposing a new glossary term, or refining a Protobuf schema, your contribution adds depth to the pond.

---

## üßº Protobuf Style & Linting

We use [Buf](https://buf.build/) to harmonize our `.proto` files. Think of it as a **Depth Song**‚Äîa rhythm that keeps our schemas clean, readable, and interoperable.

### ‚úÖ Active Rule Sets

| Rule Set               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `STANDARD`             | Core Protobuf formatting and structure                                     |
| `FILE_LOWER_SNAKE_CASE`| Ensures filenames follow `lower_snake_case.proto` convention               |

### ‚ùå Allowed Exceptions

| Rule                      | Reason for Exception                                                      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ENUM_PASCAL_CASE`        | Enum values may shimmer with alternate casing when context calls for it  |
| `RPC_ALLOW_SAME_REQUEST_RESPONSE` | RPCs may echo the same shape for request and response‚Äîlike a ripple returning |

### üß© Naming Conventions

All service names must end with `API`.  
This suffix is our **Glowroot**‚Äîa signal of clarity and purpose.

‚úÖ `UserAPI`  
‚ùå `UserService`

### üóÇÔ∏è Module-Specific Overrides

| Module Path     | Rule Set   | Exceptions         |
|-----------------|------------|--------------------|
| `proto/`        | `STANDARD` | `ENUM_PASCAL_CASE` |
| `vendor/`       | `MINIMAL`  | _(minimal linting)_|

---

### üö´ Ignored Paths

These zones are **Quiet Waters**‚Äîexcluded from linting:

- `proto/third_party/**`
- `proto/legacy/**`

---

### üéØ Rule-Specific Ignores

| Rule               | Ignored Path(s)           |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| `ENUM_PASCAL_CASE` | `proto/experimental/**`   |

---

### üí¨ Comment-Based Ignores

For rare cases, you may use inline comments to silence a lint ripple:

```proto
// buf:lint:ignore ENUM_PASCAL_CASE
enum MyEnum {
  VALUE_ONE = 0;
}
```

## üï∞Ô∏è Issue Lifecycle Management

To maintain the pond's clarity and focus, we have automated systems that manage inactive issues.

### üè∑Ô∏è Stale Issue Process

Issues are automatically managed through the following lifecycle:

1. **30 days** of inactivity ‚Üí Issue is labeled as `stale` with a notification comment
2. **7 additional days** of inactivity ‚Üí Issue is automatically closed
3. **Activity detected** ‚Üí `stale` label is removed and the cycle resets

### üîí Protected Issues

Issues with the following labels are exempt from automatic closure:

- `pinned` - Permanently important issues
- `security` - Security-related issues requiring long-term tracking  
- `critical` - Critical functionality issues
- `help-wanted` - Community contribution opportunities
- `good-first-issue` - Beginner-friendly contribution opportunities

### üåä Keeping Issues Active

To prevent automatic closure:

- **Add a comment** with updates, questions, or progress
- **Apply a protected label** (listed above) if the issue requires long-term tracking
- **Reference the issue** in commits or pull requests to show ongoing relevance

The automated system respects the living nature of our development process while maintaining focus on active work.
